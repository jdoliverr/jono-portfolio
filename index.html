            <i></i>

            <p> 
                I come from a small town where the <i>sauciest</i> place to be on the weekend was 
                Walmart. I was always locked in my room on my computer, playing video 
                games and  dreaming of developing something of my very own. Due to 
                the financial standings of my family, earning quick money became my 
                number one priority rather than chasing my dreams, which led to me delivering 
                pizzas for 6 years. I just really <i>kneaded the dough</i>. 
                One day, I finally decided I was <i>hungry</i> for more in life and because of my 
                love of video games, computers, and the internet, I began my journey to 
                become a web developer and work with a team of other passionate engineers. I gained a lot from my time in pizza that has transitioned 
                into working on a web development team. I have <i>grate</i> customer service skills, I am 
                hard working and focused, and have a real <i>pep</i> in my step when working with others. 
                Thank you for reading this little <i>slice</i> of my life and I hope to work with you 
                developing an innovative website or app, or at least make you a real mean pizza.

                <b>Comic Collector</b> - Full stack app to keep track of comic book collections. Users can create an account and store a list of comic 
                books they own as well as a wish list of comic books they would like to obtain. A key feature is the ability to track whether a user 
                has read a comic in either of their lists so you never lose track of where you are in a series.

            <p><b>Bookmarks</b> - App for storing your favorite websites as bookmarks with a 1-5 rating. Has filter functionality allowing you to filter based on minimum rating.

            <p>
                <b>Language Repetition</b> - Simple fullstack app used to help in learning a new language. It uses the learning technique 
                known as spaced repetition to teach you words you don't know. The more can correctly translate the word the less often you 
                see it and so the less you can translate the word the more frequently you see it. This is a technique commonly used with 
                flashcards and is implemented here in a similar way. On the technical side the linked list data structure is used for the 
                words to learn, keeping track of correct answers and how many times in a row you translate correctly so it can move a word 
                the appropriate amount back in the list.
